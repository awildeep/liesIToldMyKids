Simple app to help me learn better testing practices.

App build from a class with Chris Hartjes @grmpyprogrammer

App concept:
    Lies I told my kids

    Plain PHP site

        homepage - paginated display of lies
        submit page
        admin - delete/edit users/lies

    Two tables
        1. lies
            LieMapper
            LieEntity

            uuid, date, description, userid, valid
        2. user
            UserMapper
            UserEntity

            uuid, email, role (general/admin)

    General users can:
        create lies
        edit lies that belong to them
        delete lies that belong to them

    Admin users
        create lies
        edit lies that belong to them
        delete lies that belong to them

    Mappers take DB connection parameter
        then return a collection of lie/user objects
        (allows for mocking, or dsn)


Scenarios:
    get 1 lie
    get all lies
    get all valid lies
