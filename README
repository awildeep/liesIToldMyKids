This has been tested using:

    OSX 10.7.4
    Vagrant version 1.0.5
    Virtual Box 4.2.4

Usage:

    1. Get this repository into a local directory.  Something your user has access to, 
        and that your favorite editor can open up.
    
    2. In the command-line, go to the directory containing this README, and run `vagrant up`
    
    3. You should *not* see any errors when vagrant is done, if you do something went wrong.  
        This works for me, and I am not planning to offer support on this ATM.
    
    4. Setup testsite.dev (defined in the custom cookbook or Apache2). Edit your /etc/hosts
        file, and add a line like this:
        127.0.0.1   testsite.dev
    
    5. run `vagrant ssh` to open a terminal to your new VM.
        a. run `cd /vagrant` and you should see this file!  HI!
        b. run `apt-get curl`
        c. run `curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php` to get composer
        d. run `php ./composer.phar install`
        e. you should now have the required software. 

Access your server:
    
    SSH via vagrant with `vagrant ssh`
    Access the web folder in this directory via apache served from your server via:
        http://testsite.dev:8080

Hope this helps!
